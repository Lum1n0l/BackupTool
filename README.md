# BackupTool
A Basic Python Tool For Backing Up Files To Another Location

This tool can be used to backup your files to any other location on your system, including network locations. 




## To Use:
    - Open a Terminal/Powershell Session
    - Run the build_srcfile.py script to select the directories you wish to backup. 
    - Run the backuptool.py script to select your backup destination & backup frequency.
