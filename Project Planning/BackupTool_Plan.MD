# The Plan for BackupTool

# Aim: 

To create a small, lightweight Python Tool that can be executed and ran as a background process, backing up my data at a chosen time interval to a set location. 


# Basic Features:

                    - Capable of recursively copying files & directories
                    - Able to access & copy to Network Locations
                    - Actual functioning error handling
                    - As interactive as possible
                    - Possibility of expanding to a GUI.
